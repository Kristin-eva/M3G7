    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
     <!-- I think i'm giving "Hello World" a ID called greeting and so when everytime I run greeting it's "Hello World" -->
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
    <!-- This is what ChatGPT told me:

    <h1 id="greeting"></h1>: This creates an empty <h1> heading element. The id="greeting" assigns a unique identifier to the heading, so it can be targeted and manipulated by JavaScript.
        
    The <script> tag contains JavaScript code, which is used to add dynamic behavior to the webpage.

    document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";: This JavaScript code finds the HTML element with the id of "greeting" (the <h1> tag), and sets its innerHTML property to the string "Hello, world!". This means that the text "Hello, world!" will be displayed inside the <h1> tag when the page is loaded. -->
